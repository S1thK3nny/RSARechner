## Introduction

RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman) is an asymmetric cryptographic algorithm widely used for secure data transmission. This program aims to simplify the generation of RSA key pairs by providing a user-friendly interface.

## Features

- **Key Pair Generation:** Quickly calculate public and private RSA key pairs.
- **Gooey Interface:** Utilizes the Gooey library to create a visually appealing and easy-to-use graphical interface.
- **Save Output:** Optionally save the program's output to a text file for future reference.

## Getting Started

1. **Download the Release:** Get the standalone executable (.exe) from the [Releases](https://github.com/S1thK3nny/RSARechner/releases) page.
2. **Run the Program:** Simply execute the RSA Rechner.exe file to initiate the RSA key pair calculation.

## Usage

1. Input prime numbers P and Q, along with the chosen exponent E.
2. Optionally, select the "Als Text-Datei speichern" checkbox to save the console output to a file.
3. Click "Start" to initiate the RSA key pair calculation.
