## Introduction

RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman) is an asymmetric cryptographic algorithm widely used for secure data transmission. This program aims to simplify the generation of RSA key pairs by providing a user-friendly interface.

## Features

- **Key Pair Generation:** Quickly calculate public and private RSA key pairs.
- **Gooey Interface:** Utilizes the Gooey library to create a visually appealing and easy-to-use graphical interface.
- **Save Output:** Optionally save the program's output to a text file for future reference.
